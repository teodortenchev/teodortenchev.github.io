                    </header>


                    <p> It's not a life saving skill, per say, but I play the piano in public locations when possible.
                        On a few occasions people I've never met before, have come up to me while I'm practicing and
                        they are usually amazed. I tell them it's pretty simple, anybody could learn but they are almost
                        always like "no! I would never be able to do that."<br /><br />

                        I once met a guy who also plays the piano and he claimed I was way better than him when in fact
                        he was far more advanced at that point, he was either being extremely modest or he had no clue
                        how far he's made it.<br /><br />

                        We go about our lives thinking only about the bad that happens and the things we wish we could
                        do. We often discredit ourselves and our own abilities, thinking it's nothing. 90% of my day is
                        filled with thinking I am not worth it, I cannot do it, I'm ugly and unlucky, I'm... you get the
                        idea. No wonder I'm so depressed all the time. I keep putting myself down. It's as if I have
                        this drill sergeant in my head, except - he's not pushing me forward but keeping me down,
                        trampling me below his boots like a filthy maggot.<br /><br />

                        I thought new clothes would give me confidence, I thought having more money than most people my
                        age would give me confidence, I thought being financially independent would give me confidence,
                        I thought reading books on pick up, NLP*, social dynamics would give me confidence; I thought
                        getting compliments from other people on how I've improved would give me confidence. The truth
                        is, you are the only one that can boost your self-esteem and you have to first accept that you
                        are good, you are not a failure, you are improving, you're looking good, what you do matters and
                        what you have in your life so far is more than a lot of people can even hope for because they
                        are too scared to even try and reach for it. True confidence comes from the inside. It cannot be
                        bestowed upon you from the mighty gods. It's one of the most important things to conquer - the
                        battle with your own self.<br /><br />

                        It's a life and death decision really. Life being leading a good fulfilling existence and death
                        - going about your day and missing on any and every opportunity that presents to you. If you
                        choose to stay in your current mindset and go about every day like this, it will affect all
                        areas of your life. You will be just like the millions of other people who work crappy jobs and
                        hope for promotions, settle in with a girl or a guy that's average just because you will feel
                        you don't deserve better (and you'd be right, you don't in your current state), dream about
                        living the life of your dreams. What's even worse is that you will likely transfer that onto
                        your future offspring. Your children will look up to you or at least try to and they will see a
                        boring, bland person who never achieved anything. (they won't think of it like that but they
                        will subconsciously be much more prone to ending up the same way, having the same mindset as you
                        do). And when you are an old, dying man, you'll have so many regrets for all the things you
                        never did.<br /><br />


                        I know I don't want
                        that for myself. Do you?
