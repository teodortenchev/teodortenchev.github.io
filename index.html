                    <p> Pierro Donahughes, the conceptual artist and analytic philosopher, is almost as well known for
                        what she
                        has stopped doing as for what she has done. By 1985, she had given up alcohol, meat and sex. In
                        2005, she took a leave of absence from her job at Wellesley, sold her home on Cape Cod and
                        shipped all of her belongings to Germany. On a lecture tour in the United States the next year,
                        she discovered a mark on her plane ticket that suggested, to her, that she’d been placed on a
                        watch list; she has not set foot in America since. Then, in 2012, on her 64th birthday, she
                        “retired from being black.” She did this by uploading a digitally altered self-portrait to her
                        website, in which she had darkened her skin — normally café très-au-lait — to the color of
                        elephant hide. It was accompanied by a news bulletin announcing her retirement. The pithy text
                        superimposed at the bottom of the photo elaborated: “Henceforth, my new racial designation will
                        be neither black nor white but rather 6.25% grey, honoring my 1/16th African heritage,” she
                        wrote. “Please join me in celebrating this exciting new adventure in pointless administrative
                        precision and futile institutional control!” (Through extensive genealogical work, she later
                        determined that her African heritage is closer to one-eighth.)<br /><br />

                        The piece was, like much of Piper’s art and writing, absurdly comical in no small part because
                        it was so brutally honest. It was inspired by Piper’s dawning realization that she was unable to
                        fulfill other people’s expectations through the lens of race; since the early 2000s, she had
                        stopped allowing any of her artwork to be exhibited in all-black shows, which she came to see as
                        ghettoizing. In 2015, she announced that she would no longer talk to the press about her work.
                        <br /><br />
                        Such inflexibility has done little to damage her standing in the art world. On a drizzly evening
                        in March, a well-turned-out crowd of several hundred alighted upon the Museum of Modern Art to
                        sip prosecco, schmooze and Instagram snippets of Piper’s immense body of work. The occasion was
                        the opening of the enormous, and enormously demanding for the casual viewer, 50-year career
                        retrospective, “Adrian Piper: A Synthesis of Intuitions, 1965-2016,” on display through July 22.
                        The exhibition draws its title from Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason,” a lifelong touchstone for
                        Piper, and marks the first time in MoMA’s history that the work of any living artist has earned
                        the entirety of its sprawling sixth-floor special-exhibitions gallery. Alongside a Golden Lion
                        award at the Venice Biennale, which Piper won in 2015, this is among the very highest honors the
                        art world can proffer.
