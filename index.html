                        <h2>A life and death decision</h2>
                    </header>


                    <p> It's not a life saving skill, per say, but I play the piano in public locations when possible.
                        On a few occasions people I've never met before, have come up to me while I'm practicing and
                        they are usually amazed. I tell them it's pretty simple, anybody could learn but they are almost
                        always like "no! I would never be able to do that."<br /><br />

                        I once met a guy who also plays the piano and he claimed I was way better than him when in fact
                        he was far more advanced at that point, he was either being extremely modest or he had no clue
                        how far he's made it.<br /><br />

                        We go about our lives thinking only about the bad that happens and the things we wish we could
                        do. We often discredit ourselves and our own abilities, thinking it's nothing. 90% of my day is
                        filled with thinking I am not worth it, I cannot do it, I'm ugly and unlucky, I'm... you get the
                        idea. No wonder I'm so depressed all the time. I keep putting myself down. It's as if I have
                        this drill sergeant in my head, except - he's not pushing me forward but keeping me down,
                        trampling me below his boots like a filthy maggot.<br /><br />

                        I thought new clothes would give me confidence, I thought having more money than most people my
                        age would give me confidence, I thought being financially independent would give me confidence,
                        I thought reading books on pick up, NLP*, social dynamics would give me confidence; I thought
                        getting compliments from other people on how I've improved would give me confidence. The truth
                        is, you are the only one that can boost your self-esteem and you have to first accept that you
                        are good, you are not a failure, you are improving, you're looking good, what you do matters and
                        what you have in your life so far is more than a lot of people can even hope for because they
                        are too scared to even try and reach for it. True confidence comes from the inside. It cannot be
                        bestowed upon you from the mighty gods. It's one of the most important things to conquer - the
                        battle with your own self.<br /><br />

                        It's a life and death decision really. Life being leading a good fulfilling existence and death
                        - going about your day and missing on any and every opportunity that presents to you. If you
                        choose to stay in your current mindset and go about every day like this, it will affect all
                        areas of your life. You will be just like the millions of other people who work crappy jobs and
                        hope for promotions, settle in with a girl or a guy that's average just because you will feel
                        you don't deserve better (and you'd be right, you don't in your current state), dream about
                        living the life of your dreams. What's even worse is that you will likely transfer that onto
                        your future offspring. Your children will look up to you or at least try to and they will see a
                        boring, bland person who never achieved anything. (they won't think of it like that but they
                        will subconsciously be much more prone to ending up the same way, having the same mindset as you
                        do). And when you are an old, dying man, you'll have so many regrets for all the things you
                        never did.<br /><br />


                        I know I don't want
                        that for myself. Do you?

                        <h2>The unlucky ones</h2>
                    </header>


                    <p> Pierro Donahughes, the conceptual artist and analytic philosopher, is almost as well known for
                        what she
                        has stopped doing as for what she has done. By 1985, she had given up alcohol, meat and sex. In
                        2005, she took a leave of absence from her job at Wellesley, sold her home on Cape Cod and
                        shipped all of her belongings to Germany. On a lecture tour in the United States the next year,
                        she discovered a mark on her plane ticket that suggested, to her, that she’d been placed on a
                        watch list; she has not set foot in America since. Then, in 2012, on her 64th birthday, she
                        “retired from being black.” She did this by uploading a digitally altered self-portrait to her
                        website, in which she had darkened her skin — normally café très-au-lait — to the color of
                        elephant hide. It was accompanied by a news bulletin announcing her retirement. The pithy text
                        superimposed at the bottom of the photo elaborated: “Henceforth, my new racial designation will
                        be neither black nor white but rather 6.25% grey, honoring my 1/16th African heritage,” she
                        wrote. “Please join me in celebrating this exciting new adventure in pointless administrative
                        precision and futile institutional control!” (Through extensive genealogical work, she later
                        determined that her African heritage is closer to one-eighth.)<br /><br />

                        The piece was, like much of Piper’s art and writing, absurdly comical in no small part because
                        it was so brutally honest. It was inspired by Piper’s dawning realization that she was unable to
                        fulfill other people’s expectations through the lens of race; since the early 2000s, she had
                        stopped allowing any of her artwork to be exhibited in all-black shows, which she came to see as
                        ghettoizing. In 2015, she announced that she would no longer talk to the press about her work.
                        <br /><br />
                        Such inflexibility has done little to damage her standing in the art world. On a drizzly evening
                        in March, a well-turned-out crowd of several hundred alighted upon the Museum of Modern Art to
                        sip prosecco, schmooze and Instagram snippets of Piper’s immense body of work. The occasion was
                        the opening of the enormous, and enormously demanding for the casual viewer, 50-year career
                        retrospective, “Adrian Piper: A Synthesis of Intuitions, 1965-2016,” on display through July 22.
                        The exhibition draws its title from Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason,” a lifelong touchstone for
                        Piper, and marks the first time in MoMA’s history that the work of any living artist has earned
                        the entirety of its sprawling sixth-floor special-exhibitions gallery. Alongside a Golden Lion
                        award at the Venice Biennale, which Piper won in 2015, this is among the very highest honors the
                        art world can proffer.
